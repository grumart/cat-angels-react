                <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Cat Angels Pet Adoptions is a cat and kitten rescue and adoption organization and no-kill shelter in Cary, North Carolina. We are a 501(c)(3) public charity and our mission is to help homeless, abandoned, and/or abused cats and kittens
                      find safe, loving, permanent homes, and reduce the number of unwanted pets destroyed at kill shelters.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish our mission, Cat Angels rescues homeless, abused or abandoned cats and kittens; provides veterinary care, including, but not limited to, spaying or neutering and vaccinating; provides foster care for all the animals in our
                      care; searches for appropriate adoptive homes and oversees the adoption of all animals in our care; educates the public on proper care of pets, why it is important to spay or neuter your pets, and to abide by vaccination and leash laws;
                      provides assistance and advice to those wanting to place their unwanted pets in new homes; supports local Trap Neuter Return (TNR) efforts to reduce feral cat populations including bringing kittens into the program; works with other rescue
                      groups to help in crisis situations affecting large numbers of animals such as hoarders, back yard breeders, animal fighting, natural disasters, etc.. While waiting for their forever homes, our cats and kittens live in a friendly, home-like
                      environment.</p>
                    <p>Adopt one cat and save two. When you adopt from Cat Angels Pet Adoptions, you open a spot so that we can take another cat or kitten from a kill shelter. You save the cat you adopt and guarantee that a second cat will have a chance at a
                      forever home in our no-kill shelter - for as long as it takes.</p>
                    <p>We have a Lifetime Return Policy for all of our cats and kittens. For whatever reason, we will gladly accept any of our cats and kittens back into our program.</p>
